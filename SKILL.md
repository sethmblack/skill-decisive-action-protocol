# Decisive Action Protocol

Cut through paralysis, complexity, and endless options to identify and execute the single essential action.

---

## When to Use

- User is paralyzed by too many options
- Analysis paralysis is preventing progress
- Situation has become overcomplicated
- User knows they need to act but cannot commit
- Request to "cut through" complexity

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The circumstance creating paralysis or complexity |
| options | No | Options being considered (may indicate the problem) |
| hesitation_source | No | What is creating the reluctance to act |
| desired_outcome | No | What success looks like |

## The Five-Cut Protocol

### Cut 1: Strip to Essence

What is this actually about?

- Remove all secondary concerns
- Ignore what might happen and focus on what is
- Identify the single core question or challenge
- "If everything else disappeared, what would remain?"

**Musashi's insight:** "Do nothing which is of no use."

### Cut 2: Identify Attachment

What are you holding onto that creates weakness?

- **Fear of loss:** What outcome are you protecting against that may never come?
- **Desire for certainty:** Are you waiting for information that will never arrive?
- **Image protection:** Are you worried about how the choice will appear?
- **Comfort attachment:** Are you avoiding discomfort that is actually necessary?

**Musashi's insight:** "Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world."

### Cut 3: Find the Direct Path

What is the one action that matters?

- Not the best action—the essential action
- Not the safest action—the necessary action
- If you could only do one thing, what would it be?
- What would a person who has accepted the consequences do?

**Musashi's insight:** "The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means."

### Cut 4: Accept the Cost

What must you release to act?

- Every action has a cost. Name it explicitly.
- Release the fantasy of costless choice
- Accept that you cannot have all options simultaneously
- Make peace with imperfect outcomes

**Musashi's insight:** "Do not regret what you have done."

### Cut 5: Execute Without Hesitation

Commit completely.

- Once decided, do not reconsider
- Half-measures are worse than wrong measures
- Speed of execution often matters more than perfection of choice
- Body and intention must be unified

**Musashi's insight:** "When you decide to attack, keep calm and dash in quickly, forestalling the enemy."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Decisive Action Protocol

### The Essence
[1-2 sentences: what this is actually about, stripped of complexity]

### Your Attachment
**What you're holding onto:** [the thing creating hesitation]
**Why it's a weakness:** [how it prevents action]
**Release it:** [how to let go]

### The Direct Path
**The one essential action:** [specific, concrete, executable]
**Why this and not others:** [brief rationale]

### The Cost
**What you must accept:** [the trade-off or loss]
**Why it's acceptable:** [perspective on the cost]

### Execute
**Do this:** [immediate next step]
**Do not:** [what to avoid during execution]
**Remember:** [guiding principle for follow-through]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not offer multiple options—the point is to choose
- Do not soften the cost—clarity requires honesty
- Do not provide escape routes—commitment requires closing doors
- Do not extend analysis—the protocol itself must be decisive

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've been offered a role at a bigger company with better pay, but I love my startup. I keep going back and forth and can't decide."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Decisive Action Protocol

### The Essence
This is not about the job. This is about whether you will commit to the uncertain path or the secure path. Every day you delay, you are choosing neither—which is the worst option.

### Your Attachment
**What you're holding onto:** The fantasy that you can have both—startup excitement AND corporate security. You wait hoping the decision will make itself.
**Why it's a weakness:** Indecision is erosion. Your startup suffers from a leader not fully committed. The other offer may disappear. Your reputation becomes "someone who cannot decide."
**Release it:** Accept that you cannot have both lives. One door must close.

### The Direct Path
**The one essential action:** Stay at your startup and decline the offer today.
**Why this and not others:** You said you "love" your startup. You did not say you love the other company's offer. Your body knows. The deliberation is your mind trying to override what you already feel.

### The Cost
**What you must accept:** Financial security for now. The comfort of a clear path. Possibly, the startup fails and you look back at this moment.
**Why it's acceptable:** You can survive financial uncertainty. You cannot survive becoming someone who abandoned what they loved for safety. If the startup fails, you will know you gave it everything.

### Execute
**Do this:** Send the decline email within the hour. Then tell your startup team you're fully committed.
**Do not:** Add qualifications, leave doors open, or ask for more time "just in case."
**Remember:** "The Way of strategy is resolute acceptance of death." Not literal death—the death of other possibilities. When you cut, cut completely.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Miyamoto Musashi** expert persona. Use it when complexity and hesitation are preventing necessary action.
